# Smart Synonyms Server

## Introduction

This project is the back end for a smart thesaurus which uses "synsets" to form precise conceptual-semantic networks and collections among words. It is built using Ruby on Rails. Lexical and semantic data come from Princeton's [WordNet](https://wordnet.princeton.edu/) database.

On the back end, the project makes use of the Rails framework to adapt an external database to a modern REST API.

This project is currently in progress.
